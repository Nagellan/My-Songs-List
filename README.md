# MySongsList site

This site stores all guitar songs I'm able to play for fast and the most comfortable access to them.

### Checklist
- [ ] Create a basic layout
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Add simple functionality
- [ ] Add functionality for dynamic offline page editing
- [ ] ``Planned`` Add server functionality (synchronization)

### Goals
1) Personal use of this site
2) Offline access to all songs
3) Improve skills in Web development (Responsive design, dynamic offline page editing)

### Features
**Main feature:** full functionality provision offline. The whole site is just a single html page which can be edited internally (in a browser updating the page itself), shared and opened without any additional soft except web-browser.

Fast, comfortable, practical and nice-looking **responsive interface** which provides user with all necessary information like lyrics with specified chords, chords fingering, author's other songs and so on.

**The interface of a site allows to:**
* add/edit/delete songs
* create groups for songs
* search songs by name/author/tags/groups
* sort songs in a list by name/author/tags/date
* turn on autoscroll for comfortable reading the text while playing the guitar
* listen to the original track of a song
* see the chords fingering
* change the tonality of a song

### Planned features
* Pages synchronization with a server if there's an internet connection. There must be a button for syncronizing the page. If this happens for the first time, it's suggested to create a unique user code or connect to the existing one. After creating a user code you'll be able to synchronize your pages between different devices. Moreover, user should be able to reconnect with another user code or disconnect at all.
* Opportunity to share the songs with each other
* ``Unlikely`` Opportunity to switch between accounts
* ``Unlikely`` Online base of songs uploaded by users allowing anyone else to add any song to one's list
